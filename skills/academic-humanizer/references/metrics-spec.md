# Metrics specification

`scripts/metrics.py` provides reproducible descriptive diagnostics. It does not
identify an author, assign an AI probability, or decide whether prose passes.

## Routing

Routing is based on editable prose after removing fenced/inline code, formulas,
Markdown block quotations, and a trailing References/Bibliography/Works
Cited/参考文献 section. Reference headings are normalized before matching:
case, Markdown heading marks, an optional section number, surrounding whitespace,
and a trailing ASCII or full-width colon do not affect recognition. Ordinary
sentences that merely begin with `References` or `参考文献` remain prose.

`r = CJK tokens / (CJK tokens + Latin word tokens)`

Each CJK character is one orthographic token; each contiguous Latin word is one
token. This practical tokenizer favors the surrounding Chinese grammar over a
few long embedded technical names. `r >= 0.5` routes Chinese; otherwise English.
No countable prose returns `unknown` rather than defaulting to English.

## Descriptive fields

| Field | Unit | Interpretation limit |
|---|---|---|
| `lexical_diversity` | English word TTR or Chinese character diversity plus token count | length-sensitive description; no normal range |
| `sentence_length` | word count (EN) or CJK characters + Latin words (ZH) | descriptive mean, spread, min, max |
| `transitions` | sentence-initial candidates per 100 sentences | high or low values are not defects by themselves |
| `passive_candidates` | conservative English sentence candidates | misses valid passives and may retain false positives; never a style target |
| `dashes` | mutually exclusive glyph/pair counts | punctuation inventory only |
| `leaks` | context-bearing regex candidates | quotations are masked; selected research-mention contexts are excluded; contextual review remains required |
| `contrast_candidates` | pattern candidates | candidate only; use `contrast-logic.md` for the decision |

Chinese character diversity is not lexical TTR. Traditional TTR is sensitive to
text length, so values from different lengths or languages are not comparable.

## Protected-span masking

Leak and contrast scans mask direct quotations, fenced/inline code, formulas,
Markdown block quotations, and trailing references. This reduces false positives
but cannot parse every document format. Findings remain candidates.

Chinese process-leak rules distinguish three cases:

- a direct second-person request cue, such as `根据您的要求`;
- a generic request cue followed by a document target or editing action;
- an AI-style self-reference cue, excluding quoted and explicitly discussed
  research examples.

These distinctions improve candidate recall without turning a match into deletion
authority.

## Prohibited interpretations

Do not:

- combine fields into a score or probability;
- claim a universal healthy range;
- rewrite until a threshold is crossed;
- treat passive voice, transitions, sentence variance, or dashes as defects alone;
- use a regex candidate as automatic deletion evidence.

## Optional runtime commands

The skill remains fully usable without Python. When Python 3 is available, let
`<python>` be the host's launcher, `<skill-dir>` the directory containing
`SKILL.md`, and `<input-file>` a user-authorized text file. Quote paths containing
spaces and use the path separator accepted by the host shell.

```bash
<python> "<skill-dir>/scripts/metrics.py" "<input-file>" --json
<python> "<skill-dir>/scripts/metrics.py" "<input-file>" --route
```

The first command returns all descriptive fields. The second returns only the
language route. These commands do not modify the input file.

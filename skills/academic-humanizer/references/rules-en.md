# English academic rules

## 1. Activation standard

Edit only when wording is vacuous, unsupported, mechanically repeated, or part
of a reinforcing pattern cluster. A word or construction is not defective merely
because language models often use it.

Before activating a rule, ask:

- What proposition or relation does the span carry?
- Is that proposition supported by the source bundle?
- Is the wording conventional in this section or discipline?
- Would the proposed edit preserve modality, polarity, comparison, and scope?

When uncertain, keep or flag. Do not force variation for its own sake.

## 2. English pattern rules

### E1. Empty significance and novelty inflation

Candidates: `pivotal`, `groundbreaking`, `transformative`, `remarkable`,
`paradigm shift`, `watershed`, `testament to`, `underscores the importance of`.

Act when the phrase contributes only importance or novelty without a supplied
reason. Delete the inflation or state the already-supplied result. Do not invent a
number, comparison, mechanism, or implication to make the sentence concrete.

Technical uses such as `statistically significant`, a defined `paradigm`, or a
cited novelty claim remain protected.

### E2. Promotional metaphor and business vocabulary

Candidates: `landscape`, `ecosystem`, `journey`, `unlock`, `unleash`, `leverage`,
`harness`, `seamless`, `game-changing`, `at its core`, `cutting-edge`.

Act when the word is metaphorical and replaceable by a direct technical action.
Preserve literal or field-standard uses. If no direct action exists in the source,
delete the ornament rather than supplying one.

### E3. Pseudo-analysis tails

Candidate: an `-ing` clause appended after a result to add generic importance,
applicability, or promise, for example `..., highlighting the broad potential...`.

End at the result when the tail adds no claim. Preserve an `-ing` clause that
states a sourced mechanism, condition, consequence, or simultaneous action.

### E4. Unsupported rhetorical contrast

Candidates include `not X but Y`, `not merely X`, `not only X but also Y`,
`less about X and more about Y`, and split-sentence variants.

Apply [contrast logic](contrast-logic.md). Occurrence count does not determine
validity. Preserve supported experimental, definitional, scope, and reviewer-
response contrasts. Flag concrete but unverified contrasts instead of deleting
them. In additive forms, preserve both supported claims.

### E5. Inflated copula substitutes

Candidates: `serves as`, `stands as`, `represents`, `boasts`, `features` where
`is` or `has` carries the same meaning.

Use the plain verb when the original verb adds no relation. Preserve `represents`
in mathematical, sampling, or explicit representational senses.

### E6. Ornamental intensifiers

Candidates: `remarkably`, `dramatically`, `fundamentally`, `deeply`, `vastly`,
`critically`, and unsupported `significantly`.

Keep magnitude or statistical language backed by the source. Otherwise delete
the intensifier; never manufacture a quantity.

### E7. Hedge stacking

Compress constructions such as `may suggest that X could potentially...` to the
minimum hedge that preserves the original evidence strength. Do not remove the
last hedge from observational, exploratory, or uncertain claims.

### E8. Vague attribution

Candidates: `experts argue`, `studies show`, `researchers believe` without a
source or identifiable referent.

Name the supplied source when present. Otherwise retain an appropriately limited
claim or flag the missing attribution. Never invent an author or citation.

### E9. Generic challenge and conclusion formulas

Candidates: `Despite these challenges`, `future research is warranted`, `the
future looks bright`, `only time will tell`, and generic `opens new avenues`.

Delete an empty closer or retain a specific finding, limitation, or open question
already in the source. Do not add a plausible limitation or future-work item.

### E10. Template opening and meta-narration

Candidates: `In today's rapidly evolving...`, `In recent years...` without a
specific fact, `This section will explore...`, `Let us examine...`, assistant
prefaces, and process commentary.

Start with the actual subject or supplied context. Preserve conventional section
signposting when the venue uses it. Process leakage is governed by C0.

### E11. Decorative enumeration and rule-of-three

Preserve genuine three-part methods, outcomes, contributions, and criteria. Act
only when repeated triads or list scaffolds package interchangeable abstractions
without adding structure. Rewrite as direct prose; do not change the number of
substantive items.

### E12. False range and synonym cycling

- Repair `from X to Y` when X and Y do not define a scale or span.
- Use one stable term for one referent unless a distinction is intentional.

Preserve established taxonomy, true ranges, and terminology required by the
field. Never merge genuinely different participant groups or variables.

### E13. Mechanical rhythm and punctuation

Look for repeated sentence templates, repeated openings, decorative dash asides,
or paragraphs that all perform the same rhetorical sequence. Repair only the
repetition that impairs reading. A short Methods paragraph, parallel result list,
or single purposeful dash does not require variation.

Do not impose sentence-length quotas or a universal dash budget. Sentence form
follows content and section function.

### E14. Tool, format, and placeholder residue

Flag or remove from the clean artifact:

- assistant prefaces and sign-offs;
- citation-rendering tokens and attachment markers;
- AI-tool tracking parameters while preserving the clean URL;
- Markdown markers inappropriate to the target format;
- unresolved placeholders.

Never fill a placeholder, repair a citation, or infer missing metadata without a
verified source.

## 3. Generation constraints

When drafting:

1. Start from supplied claims rather than a generic historical zoom-out.
2. Do not introduce a negative premise merely to reject it.
3. Use discourse markers, passive voice, hedging, and terminology when they carry
   academic function.
4. Vary syntax only as the content warrants; do not follow a sentence-length recipe.
5. Use lists only for genuinely enumerable material.
6. End on a supplied finding, boundary, or open question, or simply stop when the
   content is complete.
7. Mark hypotheticals and missing information honestly.

## 4. Final language check

- No unsupported claim, attribution, comparison, mechanism, or limitation was added.
- No concrete negation or contrast was erased without grounding analysis.
- Functional hedging, passive voice, discourse relations, and domain terms remain.
- Promotional language and empty ceremony were removed without casualizing prose.
- Terminology and referents are stable.
- Process commentary and tool residue are absent from the clean artifact.

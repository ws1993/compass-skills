## 1. Locked content

Never rewrite:

- direct quotations, interview excerpts, epigraphs, and marked translations;
- formulas, equations, code, variables, units, and statistical notation;
- reference-list entries, citation keys, and citation markers;
- verbatim legal or policy text;
- proper nouns, model/dataset/instrument names, and user-locked text.

Suspected errors may be reported outside the clean artifact. Do not silently
repair them.

## 2. Functional discourse relations

Keep a discourse marker when it makes a real relation explicit:

- EN: Although, Whereas, However, In contrast, Therefore, Thus, Accordingly,
  Moreover, Furthermore, Specifically, Based on these results, Taken together.
- ZH: 然而、相比之下、因此、据此、此外、与此同时、具体而言、基于上述结果、综上。

Surface wording may change if addition, contrast, concession, cause, chronology,
or conclusion remains clear. Repetition alone justifies a local restructure, not
deletion of the relation.

## 3. Evidence-calibrated hedging

Preserve uncertainty that matches the evidence:

- EN: may, might, could, appears to, suggests, is associated with, is consistent with.
- ZH: 可能、或可、结果提示、与……有关、与……一致、尚不能排除。

Observational or exploratory claims must not become causal or certain. Simplify
stacked hedges only when one well-placed hedge preserves the original strength.

## 4. Passive voice and impersonal constructions

Passive voice is normal in Methods and Results when procedure or outcome matters
more than actor. Preserve examples such as `Samples were incubated`, `Participants
were randomized`, `样本被随机分组`, and `数据经清洗后用于分析`.

Only question a passive when it hides an actor whose identity is material to the
claim. Passive density alone is not a defect.

## 5. Terminology and scholarly compression

Field-standard terminology is precision, not jargon. Preserve terms such as
heteroskedasticity, calibration error, weighted interval score, ablation study,
鲁棒性、显著性、异质性、消融实验、倾向得分匹配.

Moderate nominalization and anaphoric compression (`this reduction`, `the
observation that`) are normal. Repair only empty abstraction chains.

## 6. Chinese scholarly morphology and mixed text

Protect:

- `进行 + V` when it marks a procedure naturally;
- established `性` / `化` terms;
- necessary subjectless sentences and passives;
- functional adverbs such as 约、略、基本、相对、持续;
- English abbreviations, model names, variables, and formulas in Chinese prose.

In English prose, preserve occasional Chinese names, cited titles, and terms.

## 7. Legitimate contrast

Contrast is protected when it has a source and argumentative function:

- cited prior interpretation or misconception;
- competing hypothesis, baseline, or ablation attribution;
- negative versus positive result;
- technical definition or scope exclusion;
- reviewer-response clarification tied to an actual comment;
- additive findings where X and Y are both supported.

Use `contrast-logic.md`; never decide from `not X but Y` / `不是 X 而是 Y`
alone.

## 8. Register conventions

Preserve when appropriate to the venue or requested genre:

- Introduction signposting and contribution lists in fields that use them;
- structured abstract labels;
- explicit limitation and future-work statements with concrete content;
- grant or policy language required by a form or call;
- first person where the venue permits it;
- interrogative framing when it genuinely organizes the research question.

Ask when genre convention is outcome-determinative and context does not resolve it.

## 9. Mention-versus-use escape

A phrase is not a defect when quoted, cited, or analyzed as language. Do not flag
survey items such as `"To avoid sounding like AI"`, a paper discussing
AI-sounding prose, or a quoted `not X but Y` construction as process leakage or
false opposition in the surrounding paper.
